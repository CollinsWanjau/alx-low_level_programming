# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives

### General

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tasks

#### 0. Linear search

Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

Prototype : int linear_search(int array, size_t size, int value);

[solution](0-linear.c)

#### 1. Binary Search

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using 
the Binary search algorithm

Prototype : int binary_search(int array, size_t size, int value);

[solution](1-binary.c)
